# Online-Banking-System
The online banking system in Java provides users with a secure platform to manage their financial transactions, including account access, fund transfers, and bill payments, all through a user-friendly interface. It leverages robust frameworks and libraries to ensure data protection and efficient processing of banking operations.

#Project Setup for the Online Banking System

Requirements

1.⁠ ⁠Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed on your system, preferably version 8 or above. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.


2.⁠ ⁠IDE or Text Editor: Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. Alternatively, you can use a simple text editor (like VS Code or Notepad++) and the command line to run the code.



#Steps to Set Up the Project

1.⁠ ⁠Create a New Project:

If you're using an IDE, create a new project and select Java as the project type.

If you're using a simple text editor, create a new folder (e.g., OnlineBankingSystem) to hold the project files.



2.⁠ ⁠Create a Java File:

Inside the project, create a new Java file called OnlineBankingSystem.java. This will contain the code for the entire application.



3.⁠ ⁠Copy the Code:

Copy the provided code and paste it into the OnlineBankingSystem.java file.
